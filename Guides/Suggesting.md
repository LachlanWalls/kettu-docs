# How To Make Suggestions

Kettu has a suggestion command for social command images and responses. For other suggestions please join Kettu's [support server](https://kettu.cc/support) and suggest them there.

## Suggesting Images and Art

To suggest art or images you will need an image link. You can **not** directly upload an image. You can suggest image for the following commands: `boop`, `hug`, `kiss`, `lick`, `nom`, `nuzzle`, `pounce` and `snuggle`. To use the command do `/suggest <command> <image link>`. Once you do this you will be greeted with a confirmation page as shown below.

Please make sure that the image works (shows up in the confirmation page) then click âœ…. Congrats ðŸŽ‰ You have suggested an image.

## Suggesting Responses

Submitting response is a bit different from images. The first argument should be `response` to signal that you are suggesting a response. Then provide what command you are suggesting, the list of commands is as follows: `bap`, `boop`, `cookie`, `hug`, `kiss`, `lick`, `nom`, `nuzzle`, `pat`, `pounce`, `snuggle` and `zap`. Now you can make your suggestion! Please use `{person}` to stand for the other use of the command and use `{user}` to stand for the message author. An example is as follows: `/suggest response hug {user} just gave {person} a big huggo!`.

`{user}` and `{person}` will be replaced with yourself and the bot in the confirmation page. Please verify that the response is as you are intending then click âœ….
